# TraJ
Java library for diffusion trajectory analysis

Implemented features so far:
- Compatible with 1D, 2D and 3D trajectories.
- Mean squared displacement calculation
- Covariance estimator for diffusion coefficient
- Regression estimator for diffusion coefficient
- Stokes-Einstein converter to get hydrodynamic diameter
- Global linear drift calculator
- Linear drift corrector
- Simulation: Brownian motion (free diffusion)
- Simulation: Active Transport
- Trajectories are combineable
